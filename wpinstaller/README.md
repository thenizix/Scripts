-----------------------------------------------
Note.  Some precise Errors from the Wordpress installer could be not a real error.
The correct wordpress installation would to be made from the wp php installer, so it switch to "manual install".

- Remember to secure the instance deleting any trace of installers.

-Maybe this software could have some silly redundancy or ingenuity, maybe i reinvented the wheel.. but is useful and instead to modify something, i tried to make it express from myself.
but...
I'm proud like a child of this, lost hours tryng to fixing sed , and i become a fan of awk..  
- Built in some hours using VSCode and Deepseek 3.1
- as a student i would share anyway the 42 logo, and way to learn and share, even if this is not a 42 project.
Pull it and make it better, let me know.
