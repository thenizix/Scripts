Installation of system tables failed!  Examine the logs in
/var/lib/mysql for more information.

The problem could be conflicting information in an external
my.cnf files. You can ignore these by doing:

    shell> /usr/bin/mysql_install_db --defaults-file=~/.my.cnf

You can also try to start the mariadbd daemon with:

    shell> /usr/sbin/mariadbd --skip-grant-tables --general-log &

and use the command line tool /usr/bin/mariadb
to connect to the mysql database and look at the grant tables:

    shell> /usr/bin/mariadb -u root mysql
    MariaDB> show tables;

Try '/usr/sbin/mariadbd --help' if you have problems with paths.  Using
--general-log gives you a log in /var/lib/mysql that may be helpful.

The latest information about mysql_install_db is available at
